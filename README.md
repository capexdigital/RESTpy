############################## RESTpy #############################

RESTpy is a personal project I created to learn the fundamentals of building REST APIs. It was developed using Python's Flask framework, which is lightweight. 

For database management, I used SQLAlchemy, a powerful SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) that simplifies interactions with the database.

This project served as a hands-on introduction to core concepts of APIs and the Python language.
